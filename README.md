# FIND-map
Since February 2020 the PPI Data &amp; Analytics team has been cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from GISAID, FIND, WHO, and Our World In Data. In collaboration with the team at FIND we have developed a series of maps that describe next-generation sequencing capacity. The main outputs were code, data repositories, and visualizations (owned by Leo’s Flourish account) that appear on the FIND page here along with an in-depth explanation of the methodology. There is another Flourish story (owned by Nathan’s Flourish account) that FIND has circulated but has not yet been embedded into a webpage here. This story offers a mapping of countries receiving support for developing their NGS capacity under the ACT-A Accelerator.


Overview

The charts on the FIND page include the following (in sequential order):
Methodology Slides [Flourish Link]
Overview of Data Sources and Classification Methods
Diagnostic Testing Capacity
Next-generation Sequencing Capacity
SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing
Map of NGS capacity for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in LMICs [Flourish Link]
Next-generation Sequencing Capacity Table [Flourish Link]

The unembedded story:
FIND Support Map [Flourish Link]
Map of NGS capacity for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in LMICs (with number of projects)
Country Support Map
Country Support Map - Improving Access to Tools
Country Support Map - Workforce Strengthening
Country Support Map - Enhancing Data Utility


The charts illustrate the archetype classifications of next-generation sequencing capacity around the world while providing data via tooltip on the number of GISAID sequences, diagnostic testing metrics, and sequencing capacity. These charts are updated on a monthly basis and on FIND’s request. The workflow is to use GISAID data already available from updating the PPI landing pages, run a set of scripts manually in Domino, pull this data into Flourish, copy and paste in the shape files, and then re-publish the maps.
