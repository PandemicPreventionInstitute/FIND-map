# NGS Capacity-map

Purpose: 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, extensive research demonstrates the need for genomic sequencing to monitor  infectious disease transmission, outbreak risk, and novel variant detection. Using current COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance data, The Pandemic Prevention Institute (PPI) & FIND partners to construct the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) Capacity Map, as a tool to monitor country-level diagnostic testing and sequencing capacity. The NGS Capacity Map integrates various data to highlight global testing and sequencing disparities and suggest evidence-based mitigation strategies. 

Significance: 
Since February 2020, FIND & PPI has maintain NGS Capacity map and continues to update underlying data on a monthly basis. In February 2022, PPI updated the NGS Capacity Map methodologies by using a combination of reliable data sources, robust methodologies, and recent data (2021-2022). The updated NGS Capacity data and recommendations are able to withstand the test of time and precisely monitor the current state of COVID-19 diagnostic testing and SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in resource-limited settings.  The NGS Capacity Map is a useful tool for decision-makers to conceptualize and elucidate LMICs COVID-19 diagnostic testing capacity, their access to NGS sequencing facilities, and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity in an effective and efficient manner. The updated NGS Capacity data and action-oriented recommendations are able to withstand the test of time and precisely monitor the current state of COVID-19 diagnostic testing and SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in resource-limited settings.

Getting Started:
To get started with the NGS Capacity project, review the NGS methodologies under the NGS_Methods repository. If interested in forking or assessing underlying datasets, you have two options 1) use the short version of the NGS data containing 15 key variables under the data --> NGS_Data_Tables --> Month, Year --> clean_dataset, or 2) use the full underlying dataset, containing all 25 metrics used in calculation and formation of new variables under data --> NGS_Data_Tables --> Month, Year --> full_dataset. Associated codebooks per dataset can be found in the same repositories the datasets are hosted under.

Our github also hosts further information regarding the NGS exploratory data analysis at scripts --> data_analysis --> NGS_v1_redefine_archetypes.ipynb. The exploratory data analysis python script walks users through the thorough methodologies, from study population inclusion/exclusion criteria, key metric selection, summary statistics exploration, and threshold values determined to define "sufficient diagnostic testing capacity" and "sufficient SARS-CoV-2 sequencing capacity".
