# NGS Capacity-map
Since February 2020 the PPI Data &amp; Analytics team has been cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from GISAID, FIND, WHO, and Our World In Data. In collaboration with the team at FIND we have developed a series of maps that describe next-generation sequencing capacity. The main outputs were code, data repositories, and visualizations (owned by Leo’s Flourish account) that appear on the FIND page here along with an in-depth explanation of the methodology. There is another Flourish story (owned by Nathan’s Flourish account) that FIND has circulated but has not yet been embedded into a webpage here. This story offers a mapping of countries receiving support for developing their NGS capacity under the ACT-A Accelerator.


Overview

The charts on the FIND page include the following (in sequential order):
1) Methodology Slides [Flourish Link: https://app.flourish.studio/story/921884/], 
  1a)Overview of Data Sources and Classification Methods
  1b) Diagnostic Testing Capacity
  1c) Next-generation Sequencing Capacity
  1d) SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing
2) Map of NGS capacity for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in LMICs [Flourish Link: https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/6684101/edit]
3) Next-generation Sequencing Capacity Table [Flourish Link: https://app.flourish.studio/story/951937/edit]

The charts illustrate the archetype classifications of next-generation sequencing capacity around the world while providing data via tooltip on the number of GISAID sequences, diagnostic testing metrics, and sequencing capacity. These charts are updated on a monthly basis and on FIND’s request. The workflow is to use GISAID data already available from updating the PPI landing pages, run a set of scripts manually in Domino, pull this data into Flourish, copy and paste in the shape files, and then re-publish the maps.
